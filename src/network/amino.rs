//! Ported verbatim from midstate `src/network/amino.rs`; only the rendezvous
//! label changed, so this network and midstate never share a DHT key.
//!
//! Amino (public IPFS/libp2p) DHT rendezvous — borrowed-commons peer discovery.
//!
//! # Reasoning
//!
//! Midstate's cold-start path depends entirely on operator-run infrastructure:
//! two hardcoded bootstrap VPS nodes and a Cloudflare Worker on a domain that
//! must be renewed forever. If that infrastructure lapses, existing nodes carry
//! on (they restore from the on-disk address book) but **no new node can ever
//! join**, and the network dies by attrition.
//!
//! This module removes that dependency by publishing a provider record on the
//! public IPFS DHT — infrastructure operated by several independent parties who
//! have never heard of this project, and which has run for years without anyone
//! associated with Midstate lifting a finger.
//!
//! ## Why a separate Swarm
//!
//! The obvious implementation adds a second `kad::Behaviour` to
//! `MidstateBehaviour`. That does not work: `kad::Config::default()` uses the
//! protocol name `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0`, which is exactly what the existing Midstate
//! Kademlia already claims, and two sub-behaviours in one `NetworkBehaviour`
//! cannot share a protocol name. Resolving that would mean renaming the
//! Midstate DHT, which partitions Kademlia across the version boundary.
//!
//! Running Amino as an isolated Swarm avoids the collision entirely:
//! - Zero changes to `MidstateBehaviour`; no protocol rename; full wire
//!   compatibility with existing nodes.
//! - Foreign IPFS peers can never enter the Midstate routing table, and
//!   Midstate queries can never leak into a foreign network.
//! - The whole subsystem can be disabled or deleted without touching
//!   consensus-adjacent networking code.
//!
//! Per `docs/standards.md` §3 this is **Tier 3** — it touches neither money nor
//! consensus state. Reasoning and pre/post conditions are mandatory; Z schemas
//! are given only for the two operations with real external state impact.
//!
//! # Safety / Invariants
//!
//! - **Discovery is not trust.** Every address produced here is fed through the
//!   normal `dial_addr` path and must still pass the full Midstate handshake:
//!   protocol id, genesis match, and a chain consistent with known checkpoints.
//!   A wholly poisoned provider set costs dial attempts and nothing else.
//! - **Never load-bearing.** Any failure — no bootstrap peers, DNS blocked, DHT
//!   unreachable — degrades to the other seed sources and never blocks startup.
